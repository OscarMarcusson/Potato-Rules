## Skills
Once you have chosen your ***attributes***, itâ€™s time to choose your ***skills***. You're free to choose any ***skill*** you wish and bring them up to any level you want to as long as you have the required ***character creation points (CCP)*** to do so. The cost of increasing ***skills*** depend on the ***attribute scaling*** as can be seen in the table below.

<TODO>***SEE SKILL LIST*** for the list of skills.
