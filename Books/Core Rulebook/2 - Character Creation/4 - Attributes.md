## Attributes

### Starting Attribute Levels
You begin with either **half** your ***aptitude*** rounded down or your ***aptitude – 15***, whichever is **larger**. This means that with an ***aptitude*** of 30 or lower you use half, any ***aptitude*** higher leads to an attribute level of ***aptitude – 15***. For example, if you have a ***strength aptitude*** of 13 your ***strength level*** starts as 6. If you have a ***strength aptitude*** of 47, your strength level starts at 38.


### Increasing or Decreasing
The fourth step is to distribute some of your ***CCP*** into your ***attributes***. A good rule of thumb is to spend anything from 20 to 50 percent of the ***CCP*** on ***attributes*** and the rest on ***skills***, but if your character has spent their entire life doing nothing but lifting weights then you should put all points into ***strength***.

Up to and including level | Cost per level
---                       | ---:
Aptitude                  | 1
Aptitude × 2              | 2
Aptitude × 3              | 4
Aptitude × 4              | 7
Anything higher	          | 11 

To further explain the above table, if you have an aptitude of 11, you would have the following costs:  
Up to and including level 11 would cost 1 point per level.  
Up to and including level 22 would cost 2 point per level.  
Up to and including level 33 would cost 4 point per level.  
Up to and including level 44 would cost 7 point per level.  
All higher levels would cost 11 points per level.


### Calculating Attribute Scaling Values
When you are done with your ***attribute levels***, it’s time to calculate the ***attribute scaling*** values.
