## Traits
The third and most interesting step is to select your traits. While some of the traits can be chosen at your own leisure it is strongly recommended to choose them together with the ***GM*** to make sure that it makes sense for the world and story, and being just overall playable.  
See ***Traits*** (page **XXX**) for the list of ***traits***.
