# Character Creation
The following pages cover character creation, what you start with and how you increase or decrease the values. The same process can of course be used for non-player characters and creatures too, but due to the time it takes it's recommended to estimate the values for those.

The first thing to do before creating your character is to, together with the group, decide how powerful your characters will be compared to the world around you. In most campaigns you start at average or strong and increase it from there as you play, but you may play as the weakest or strongest individuals as well. Refer to the table below to see how many character creation points (***CCP***) and talent points (***TP***) that you start with:

Power              | ***CCP***| ***Talent Points***
---                | ---:     | ---:
Weak               | 60       | 6
Average            | 100      | 10
Strong             | 140      | 14
Very strong        | 180      | 18
Peak natural power | 220      | 22
Demigod            | 1 000    | 100
God                | 10 000 + | 1000 +

These character creation points will be used in the following steps, as they will let you customize your character by allocating the points into ***skills***, ***attributes*** and ***traits***.
