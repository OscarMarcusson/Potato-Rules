## Background

### Backstory
While not everyone likes building backstories, character backgrounds should still be explored for a number of reasons. Even if it is not written in detail, the background will make it easier to role play the character, as you have an idea of where the character has been and where he or she should go. The backgrounds also give you non-player characters to work with, be that an old teacher, a rival or just a kind old lady who tends to give you apple pies whenever you come to visit. Not only do you have the chance of getting pies, the ***GM*** now has more characters to play with during the campaign!

<TODO> ***SEE BACKGROUNDS*** for examples and suggestions for how you can construct a simple background.


### Equipment, Items, & Gold
It is up to you and the ***GM*** to decide the type and amount of equipment, items and gold you should begin with based on your backstory. There are no set limits or minimal amounts, but you can refer to the following tables for the average amount of gold given depending on the power of the characters. You can then use this to purchase equipment and items, but some might be given to you by family or stolen from enemies. 

Power              | Gold
 ---               | ---:
Weak               | 20
Average            | 100
Strong             | 500
Very strong        | 7,000
Peak natural power | 100,000
Demigod            | Yes
God                | Yes

*Once you reach god-like power it becomes impossible to assign any form of "default treasure", mostly because you'll already own the world itself.*
