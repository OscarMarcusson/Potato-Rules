## Secondary Attributes & Health

### Height & Weight
Decide what your ***height*** and ***weight*** will be. They are both based on a racial average, but feel free to change it as you see fit, as long as the ***GM*** allows it. See ***Character Stats: Secondary Attributes*** (page **XXX**) for more details. 


### Secondary Attributes & Health Values
With the finalized ***attribute levels*** as well as your ***height*** and ***weight*** you may now calculate the ***secondary attributes*** and ***health*** values. Follow the calculations seen in ***Character Stats: Secondary Attributes*** (page **XXX**) and ***Character Stats: Heath*** (page **XXX**). If you go back and change any ***attributes*** you may have to redo this step.
