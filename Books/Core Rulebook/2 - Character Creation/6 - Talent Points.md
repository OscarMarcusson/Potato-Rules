## Talent Points
Use the ***talent points*** to become talented in the ***skills*** of your choice. See ***Skills : Alternate Simplified Attribute Scaling Limit***.

An alternate rule for the attribute scaling limit is to limit the scaling with the skill level. That is to say, if you have a skill at level 7, the scaling can at most add another 7, for a total of 14.  
Talented or Inapt (page 9) for more information about skills and the different talent levels. 

Talented Level | Talent Point Cost | Cost From Zero
 ---           | ---:              | ---:
Talented (+1)  | 1                 | 1
Talented (+2)  | 2                 | 3
Talented (+3)  | 3                 | 6
Talented (+4)  | 4                 | 10
Talented (+5)  | 5                 | 15
Talented (+6)  | 6                 | 21
Talented (+7)  | 7                 | 28

*If it begins under 0, it costs 1 per level.*


### Advanced Skills
Advanced skills cost one more talent point per level. Talented (+1) costs 2, talented (+2) costs 3 etc. This also means that skills that begin at a level below zero cost two points per increase up to zero.

Talented Level | Talent Point Cost | Cost From Zero
