## Aptitude Increase
The second step in character creation is to decrease or increase the attribute ***aptitude*** values to give your character the potential you want it to have. You start with 3 points, and for every 3 ***aptitude levels*** you remove (to a minimum level of 1) you get 1 additional point. These points are then used to increase any combination of ***aptitude levels*** you want, be that putting all the points into one ***aptitude*** or splitting them over multiple ***aptitudes***.
